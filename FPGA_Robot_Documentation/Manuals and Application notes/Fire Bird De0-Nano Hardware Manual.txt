1. Introduction
Thanks for choosing the Fire Bird mobile robot platform. Fire Bird will give you good
exposure to the world of robotics ,FPGA System and embedded systems via NIOS Processor. 
You will be able to create and contribute to complex applications that run on this platform,
helping you acquire expertise as you spend more time with them.

Safety precautions:
	• Robot’s electronics is static sensitive. Use robot in static free environment.
	• Read the assembling and operating instructions before working with the robot.
	• If robot’s battery low then immediately charge the batteries.
	• To prevent fire hazard, do not expose the equipment to rain or moisture.
	• Refrain from dismantling the unit or any of its accessories once robot is assembled.
	• Charge the LI-ion battery only with the charger provided with the robot.
	• Never allow LI-ion battery to deep discharge.
	• Mount all the components with correct polarity.
	• Keep wheels away from long hair or fur.
	• Keep the robot away from the wet areas. Contact with water will damage the robot.
	• To avoid risks of fall, keep your robot in a stable position.
	• Do not attach any connectors while robot is powered ON.
	• Never leave the robot powered ON when it is not in use.
	• Disconnect the battery charger after charging the robot.

Inappropriate Operation:
Inappropriate operation can damage your robot. Inappropriate operation includes, but is not
limited to:
	• Dropping the robot, running it off an edge, or otherwise operating it in an irresponsible
	manner.
	• Interfacing new hardware without considering compatibility
	• Overloading the robot above its payload capacity.
	• Exposing the robot to wet environments.
	• Continuing to run the robot after hair, yarn, string, or any other item has become
	entangled in the robot’s axles or wheels.
	• All other forms of inappropriate operation.
	• Using robot in areas prone to static electricity.
	• Read carefully paragraphs marked with caution symbol.

3. Using Fire Bird Robot
In this chapter various components of the robot and their principal of operations are explained 
in detail. It is very important that user go through chapter before starting to use robot.

Fire Bird robot has 6 important modules:
1. Power management
2. Sensing
3. Actuation (locomotion)
4. Other peripherals
5. Communication
6. Intelligence (microcontroller)

3.2 Powering up Fire Bird 
	Fire Bird V has onboard rechargeable 11.1V, 2.2Ah Li-ion battery which can power the
	robot. In case experiments are to be performed for an extended period robot can also be powered 
	by external power supply.
	- Battery Connection photos(3.2.1 - Power Switch, 3.2.2 - Position of power switch, 3.2.3 - External Supply and Battery supply)
	Figure 3.1.1 shows power switch which is required for battery as well as external power supply. Fully charged Li-ion
	batteries will get completely discharged with in a week. You need to charge the robot batteries before using the robot. 
	Robot is loaded with the program to display line sensor value on 16*2 LCD Display.
	For running the robot on battery power or external power, refer to the section 3.4 and 3.5.
3.3 Power management system on the Fire Bird
	Fire Bird is powered by 11.1 V, 2.2Ah rechargeable Li-ion battery pack. When it is fully charged,
	battery pack gives 12.84 V. When it is fully discharged, voltage drops to about 10.6V. To avoid
	any damage to the batteries, only use charger provided with the robot.
3.4 Powering the robot on battery power
	To turn on the robot on the battery power, make sure that battery is connected to the robot and
	move the power switch towards forward direction as shown in 3.2.1
3.5 Powering the robot on external power
	To turn on the robot on the external power, make sure that charger is connected to the robot and
	move the power switch towards forward direction as shown in 3.2.1
